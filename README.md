# 2D Space Shooter (Complete Unity Project)

This is a complete project of a very simple 2D space shooter game created with Unity.
The game itself is not refined, yet it contains all the "ingredients"
needed to learn the paradigms underlying videogames development including (but not limited to) 
player-enemies interaction, physics, GUI, sounds, 2D parallax, etc.
The game is released under a Creative Commons License.

The C# code for Unity3D has been written from scratch and the gameplay kept simple for
didactic purposes.
